//task - test driven development approach - when it gets to right data, extract data like status
//serach on npm to find a program that understands xml - xml2json
// json.status to give status 

//finish off test to finish current test so it returns data
// test to make sure u get json
// use library read xml from process fn

//dummy test to make sure it works
 test('dummy test', () => {
   expect(1).toEqual(1);
});
